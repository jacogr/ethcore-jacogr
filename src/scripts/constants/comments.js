    salary: 'Without beating around the bush, this is quite a it below my range and experience. Negotiation is on the table, I know that I can bring more than you planned for, resulting in a win-win. What about some part in ETH?',
    industry: 'I have been involved with Bitcoin as an buyer since late 2012 (having dimissed it totally in 2010). As for Ethereum, actually stumbled across it only in Jan 2016 after I wanted to write some Bitcoin gambling site... Well, I have been hooked since, contracts, interfaces - not enough to satisfy the learning appetite, but enough to keep me sane.',

    staticcodeanalysis: 'For JavaScript CodeClimate does work wonders, although their engine config is not quite optimal yet for JS, relying on an older forked ESLint version. Combine that with a local ESLint/Sass-Lint/Pug-Lint and coding can be checked for multiple style, use and other issues.',

    html5: 'Wider than just the additional tags introduced, HTML5 still has some way to grow for exotic features - we live in interesting times. The challenge is more around not what you should use, but rather what you should not use',
    javascript: 'We have come a long way and I would have never expected myself to use JS on both the server and the client, but here we are. It does have its moments, provided you apply some rigour and ES2015 has definately helped. Frameworks are a bit of a wild wild west, but it is improving.',
    node: 'Yes. Current propritary projects I am involved in are all a combination of client/server JS, with a mixture of code-sharing between the sides. I never would have imagined this as a solid option in 1996 when I was knee deep in C++ and only saw JS as a way to pop up alert boxes on the browser.',

    frameworks: 'Biggest strength is on AngularJS (extensive 1.x, no production 2.x experience) and have been using Polymer and React (as in this project) lately to expand my horizons. Apart from my initial JSX knee-jerk, the latter has been quite good, not without its warts, but productive. Familiar with Meteor, however have never viewed it as a real-contender, rather as a slightly-less attractive approach.',

    server: 'I used to be a C++ developer in the days when interpreted languages and garbage collection was still frowned-upon. In addition I am familiar with Ruby (not Rails as much) and used to be able to wrangle the Python serpent with the best of them. Alas, no-use have gotten in the way. Rust and Go are on my 2016 \'learn and play with\' list, sadly I am a bit behind since I got into Ethereum - and there is only so much time to play.',
    gametheory: 'I am familiar with the basics (I love reading), however from a pure mathematical viewpoint, I am nowhere. Yes, a lot of this forms the backbone of the industry, so I guess my knowledge is just enought to be dangerous.',
    cryptography: 'Once again, no expert. I know enough that I am not duped by Ethereum using Keccak256 (as opposed to SHA3), know where to find best-practices and why it is a bad idea to try and implement this yourself. Conscious incompetence, I do not have the skills or background to be hardcore in this.',
