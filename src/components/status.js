    'salary': 'Without beating around the bush, this is quite a it below my range and experience. Negotiation is on the table, I know that I can bring more than you planned for, resulting in a win-win. What about some part in ETH? (Saves me investing each month via the Fiat -> BTC -> ETH bridges)',
    'industry': 'I have been involved with Bitcoin as an buyer since late 2011 (having dimissed it off the bat in 2010). As for Ethereum, actually stumbled across it only in January 2016 after I wanted to write some Bitcoin gambling site... Well, I have been hooked since, contracts, interfaces - not enough to satisfy the learning appetite, but enough to keep me sane.',

    'staticcodeanalysis': 'For JavaScript CodeClimate does work wonders, although (by default) they rely on jshint as opposed to eslint (their engine config is not quite optimal yet for the latter). Combine that with a local ESLint and coding can be checked for the simpler issues.',
