    salary: 'Without beating around the bush, this is quite a it below my range and experience. Negotiation is on the table, I know that I can bring more than you planned for, resulting in a win-win. What about some part in ETH? (Saves me investing each month via the Fiat -> BTC -> ETH bridges)',
    industry: 'I have been involved with Bitcoin as an buyer since late 2012 (having dimissed it totally in 2010). As for Ethereum, actually stumbled across it only in Jan 2016 after I wanted to write some Bitcoin gambling site... Well, I have been hooked since, contracts, interfaces - not enough to satisfy the learning appetite, but enough to keep me sane.',

Apart from my initial JSX knee-jerk, the latter has been quite good, not without its warts, but productive. Familiar with Meteor, however have never viewed it as a real-contender, rather as a slightly-less attractive approach.'
